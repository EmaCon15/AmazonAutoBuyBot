# AmazonAutoBuyBot
## Description
Bot developed in a few days that uses selenium to automate the control and possible purchase of price errors/ discounts recursive on amazon.
The script supports more than one product at the same time, for each product you can choose a limit price and whether to enable auto-checkout.
